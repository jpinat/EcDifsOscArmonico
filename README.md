Case of a particle subjected to a force in one dimension, in particular the harmonic oscillator; differential equations obeyed by the system. Euler's method to solve them.  To obtain a more precise solution, namely one that conserves Energy and generates reversible trajectories in time, we will use Verlet's method. There are several very effective methods to solve the motion of particles. When you want to do it accurately, a particularly effective method is the Runge-Kutta of order 4.
